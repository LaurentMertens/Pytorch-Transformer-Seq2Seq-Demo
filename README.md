# About
This code contains a simple working example of a Seq2Seq
Transformer network.

It contains two variants, one with batches where all elements
have equal length (transformer_demo.py), and one with batches with sequences with
different lengths (tranformer_demo_with_masks.py).

The networks are implemented using PyTorch.
